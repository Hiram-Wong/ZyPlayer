**It is normal that some channels are not labeled, which is controlled by third-party data platforms.**

- Configuration parameter {'{'}name{'}'}(identify the name of the station) is required.
- e.g. `https://epg.xxx.com/logo/{name}.png`

> Priority: [Channel's own logo field] > [Setting-Live Config-Single Source-Logo field] > [Setting-BasicConfig-Live- Logo field]
